        "content": "Bio-orthogonal chemistries are constructed around chemical partners that remain functional and react selectively even in the complex biological milieu. The team at MGH CSB and our collaborators have been at the forefront of exploring these reactions, developing the singularly fast and adaptable bio-orthogonal ligation of tetrazines (Tz) and trans-cyclooctenes (TCO) into a versatile toolkit for connecting and disconnecting biomolecules on demand. Leveraging these efforts, we aimed to re-tool serial immunostaining to make it compatible with living cells and tissues: fast, nontoxic, and high-performance. We embedded a highly stable and efficient scissile linker (C2TCO, invented at CSB) within a scaffold that exploits non-covalent fluorophore-quencher interactions to turbocharge its reactivity. Paired with an optimized “Tz scissors”, this architecture for scission-accelerated fluorophore exchange (SAFE) boosts the intrinsic Tz/TCO reaction rate by more than 3,000-fold, enabling us to erase fluorescent signals (>99% clearance) from live antibody-labelled cells in seconds at nontoxic nanomolar concentrations.",

        "content": "Patients and Physicians alike are looking for the best protocols to identify disease and to track therapy. Often these tools employ expensive nuclear diagnostics such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). These two methodologies have become the gold standard diagnostic tool in combination with anatomical imaging such as computed tomography (CT), however they are still rather inaccessible to most of the world due the cost and necessary infrastructure to produce isotopes and maintain these instruments. While we push PET and SPECT technology into whole body and exceedingly multiplex capable imaging systems, newer and more cost-effective nuclear diagnostics are still very much needed worldwide. ",

        "content": "Pathologies that belong to different types of multiple sclerosis display a range of neuropathological symptoms that all result in nerve damage instigated by the body’s own immune cells. Neural cells that transmit signals along the length of the nerve fibres need to be protected by a fatty acid layer – the myelin sheath – that becomes scarred in MS, leading to the progressive loss of signal transmission. In the brain, a series of protective layers prevents the infiltration of cells and other compounds, including imaging agents, to reach the brain. The most up-to-date experimental model that effectively recapitulates some of the early events that lead to MS include the breaking down of the protective layers in the central nervous system (CNS). In particular, white blood cells, or leukocytes, are thought to be in part responsible for disease onset as they cross the inner seal of the microvasculature, effectively rupturing the blood–brain barrier (BBB), and then also manage to cross the parenchymal basement membrane. In the mouse model, only the second step has been associated with symptomatic disease progression and is therefore considered a critical event in MS onset.",

        "content": "A couple of years ago, as a trained tumour biologist with strong interest in the tumour microenvironment, I never envisioned ever making relevant contributions to non-cancer fields. Then I joined Dr. Peter Friedl’s lab at the MD Anderson Cancer Center to start a project with the aim to combine intravital multiphoton microscopy with tissue engineering to monitor tumour progression in collaboration with the team of Dr. Dietmar Hutmacher. Scaffolds made with polycaprolactone (PCL), a polymer that has recently been re-discovered for many clinical applications after years of oblivion1 represented a key component of the experimental setting. As a first trial, we tested whether PCL fibres could be detected by multiphoton microscopy. The first scan already revealed that third harmonic generation, a contrast modality that we had just discovered to be relevant for cancer imaging2, gave outstanding imaging definition in vitro, so that even substructures within the fibres could be resolved. We then tested whether PCL fibres could be detected after implantation in vivo, and therefore used a window-chamber system in living mice, a very popular approach for intravital imaging in (and outside) our lab. This titanium chamber integrates a glass and, when surgically implanted onto the mouse skin fold, provides direct access for the observation of subcutaneous tissue and any implanted tissues or materials3.",
